This is my take on a classic 2D runner game
In this game I used Unity3D and put a strong emphasis on game feel and fluidity. 
Although it is a simple game, I elevated it by using bold colours, and beautiful particle systems. 
In addition, I implemented features such as camera shake, time dialation, and audio queues. You can check out gameplay screenshots under the "Gameplay Screenshots" folder!
